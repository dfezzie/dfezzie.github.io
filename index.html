            <h1>Hello! &#x1F44B;</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my site. I'm a Software Engineering Manager based in Seattle. I currently am leading the Amazon Games
                Anti Cheat Platform team, working to improve the player experience by removing bad actors from our games.
                My past experience ranges from building an AWS service to manage application networking with Envoy proxies,
                digital fulfillment of video games, and building a learning platform to help improve onboarding for solutions architects.
            </p>
            <p>When I'm not working, you'll find me chasing my three children down the street, walking my dogs and chatting with my wife.
                I also make some time to play video games, tinker with new tech, and watch the occasional Netflix show.
                I'm currently playing Marvel Snap and Baldur's Gate 3,
                and am interested in building some frontend skills and playing with generative AI.
